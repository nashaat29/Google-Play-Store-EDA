## 1 - Data Cleaning

The initial step of the project involves data cleaning using pandas. We will ensure the data's consistency and quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering out irrelevant information.

## 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Visualization

After cleaning the data, we will delve into exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. We will explore statistical summaries, distributions, and relationships between different attributes. Using data visualization libraries, we will create insightful charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to better understand the dataset.

## 3 - Summary of Key Findings

Through data analysis and visualization, we aim to extract valuable insights, including:

- Identifying the most popular app categories based on rating count and average number of installs.
- Exploring correlations between app rating, rating count, and other attributes to understand user preferences.
- Visualizing the distribution of app ratings to determine overall user satisfaction.
- Analyzing app sizes across different categories to gain insights into space utilization trends.
- Investigating the impact of in-app purchases and ads on app popularity and ratings.
- Observing the trend of app releases over time and understanding how average app ratings change over time.
- Examining the relationship between editor's choice designation and app ratings or installs.

## Conclusion

The Google Play Store Apps Dataset EDA project showcases the power of Python and its data manipulation and visualization libraries. By mastering pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy, we can efficiently explore large datasets and uncover meaningful patterns and trends. The insights obtained from this project can provide valuable knowledge for developers, marketers, and decision-makers in the mobile app industry. We look forward to a data-driven exploration of the Google Play Store Apps Dataset! ðŸš€ðŸ“ŠðŸ“±
